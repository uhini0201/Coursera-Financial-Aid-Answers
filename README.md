Would you consider using a low-interest loan to pay for your courses?If you answered no, please help us understand why.

Sir, the financial status of the family is not too good to pay the loan amount. We already have a lot of dept in the bank and my parents are paying it on regular basis. It would make their life even harder to add a new loan over them. Sir, i don't want to put any pressure over them.
